Project 758: Confidence Calibration for Neural Networks
Description:
Confidence calibration refers to the process of aligning the predicted probabilities of a machine learning model with the true likelihood of an event. In other words, a model should provide confidence scores (predicted probabilities) that match the actual frequency of an event occurring. For example, if a model predicts a probability of 0.8 for an event, that event should occur about 80% of the time. In this project, we will implement confidence calibration techniques, specifically Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression, for a Neural Network model trained on the Iris dataset. We will use these techniques to improve the calibration of the model’s predictions and evaluate their effectiveness.

Python Implementation (Confidence Calibration with Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression)
We will train a Neural Network on the Iris dataset, calibrate the model using Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression, and evaluate its calibration performance using the Brier score.

Explanation:
Dataset Loading and Preprocessing: We load the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers across three species. We split it into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Building: We build a simple neural network with two hidden layers using Keras. The model uses a softmax output layer for multi-class classification (since there are three species).

Calibration with Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression:

Platt Scaling is used for logistic calibration of the model’s predicted probabilities. It fits a logistic regression model on the output of the neural network.

Isotonic Regression is a non-linear calibration technique that fits a piecewise constant function to the model’s predicted probabilities.

Both methods are implemented using CalibratedClassifierCV from Scikit-learn.

The Brier score loss is used to evaluate the calibration of the model. A lower Brier score indicates better calibration.

Calibration Curve Visualization: The plot_calibration_curve() function visualizes the calibration curve for the calibrated models. A well-calibrated model’s curve should closely match the diagonal line, which represents perfect calibration.

Model Evaluation: We calculate the accuracy of the model on the test set and then compare the Brier scores for the original model, Platt Scaling, and Isotonic Regression models. We also visualize the calibration curves for both calibration techniques.

This project demonstrates confidence calibration techniques to improve the quality of model predictions. Proper calibration ensures that the model’s predicted probabilities are trustworthy, which is essential for decision-making in many real-world applications.
